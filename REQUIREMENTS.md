# API Description
The company stakeholders want to create an online storefront to showcase their great product ideas. Users need to be able to browse an index of all products, see the specifics of a single product, and add products to an order that they can view on a cart page. I have been tasked with building the API that will support this application, and I am building the front-end app as well.

These are the notes from a meeting with the frontend developer that describe what endpoints the API needs to supply, as well as data shapes the frontend and backend have agreed to meet the requirements of the application.
